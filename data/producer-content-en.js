      "The past five years saw that the majority of the software industry embraced the essential role played by DDD in software architecture design. It is evident that the effects of DDD are given the full play in many aspects of software architecture design, including Microservice Architecture, Revolutionary Architecture, Enterprise Architecture design and enterprise mid-end design. It is hoped that this forum can deliver many fruits of software architecture design so that the attendees can fully understand the value and power of DDD."

      "Ubiquitous language (UL) is essential to domain-driven design (DDD). Eric Evans believes constructing a ubiquitous language within a domain of context is a prerequisite for DDD strategies. The UL varies in terms of meaning and building process in different organizations. In this sub-forum, we will pay attention to the precise meaning and value of UL in various context and research ways to realize an UL."
