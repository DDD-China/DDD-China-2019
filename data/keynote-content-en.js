    topic: "The Rise of Ubiquitous Language",
    des:
      "Ubiquitous Language is essential to all applications of Domain-Driven Design (DDD). Past applications prove that language is often fragile and easily compromised. We find these attributes from the challenges of discovering Ubiquitous Language from newly-built system and of rediscovering Ubiquitous Language from legacy system. After going through many projects, a great number of teams recognize that the success of DDD lies in discovering and maintaining Ubiquitous Language with sufficient collaboration and they are trying different approaches for consolidating the process.\nThis year, Wang Wei will deliver the opening address to guide you through a journey of exploring Ubiquitous Language. It is hoped that you can appreciate the importance of Ubiquitous Language in implementation. At the meantime, we hope to discover Ubiquitous Language for collaborative design and enterprise architecture with you during this DDD conference."

    topic: 'The Expanding "Design Domain" of a Digitalized World',
    des:
      'From our physical world to the digitalized world, the problem domain in design has been studied and recognized continuously. Humans are both the user of the digitalized world and the creator of the new world, which means we have greater power for faster iteration and evolution of design. By integrating DDD and the core concepts, let us take a closer look at the "design domain" emerging from the digitalized world from the design perspective.'

    topic: "Building New DDD Knowledge System",
    des:
      "Since Domain-Driven Design (DDD) was introduced by Eric Evans in the 1990s, it has gained industry recognition and attention with the development of software engineering protocols and applications. However, its knowledge system needs to be updated and organized so that it can conform to the trends of software and technology development under the new circumstances and help companies building capability assessment standards and ability training system for software development team in DDD.\nThe keynote speech introduces the idea of building new DDD knowledge system, discussing the must-have knowledge and approach for DDD at the macro and micro levels and the development process and principles that one must follow when implementing DDD. We also cover a wide range of best practices in project management, demand analysis, architecture, design, development and testing. We detail the sticking points and challenges in implementing DDD. We talk about how to build a DDD-based model to assess the domain driven capability maturity, create the roadmap to cultivate team capability and help enterprises growing industry-oriented domain knowledge and domain model asset."

      "Mars is the next destination for humans to explore and colonize in our journey through the solar system and beyond. For the past thirty years, the space programs of many nations have been sending landed platforms of increasing complexity, revealing the Red Planetâ€™s ancient past. One of the most challenging aspects of all missions to Mars is the safe landing on the surface, from an initial entry speed of 30,000 miles per hour to a soft touchdown. During the descent to the surface, robots and eventually people are protected from extreme temperatures and G-forces by complex engineered systems. On the surface future explorers must be able to survive radiation and low pressures, with only the limited resources they can bring with them. This talk will discuss the motivation for Mars exploration and how engineering challenges are tackled with computational modeling, cutting-edge technologies, and out-of-the-box thinking. Engineering the Red Planet is the key to our future and understanding our past.",
