                                Ubiquitous language (UL) is essential to domain-driven design (DDD). 
                                Eric Evans believes constructing a ubiquitous language within a domain of context is a prerequisite for DDD strategies. 
                                The UL varies in terms of meaning and building process in different organizations. 
                                In this sub-forum, we will pay attention to the precise meaning and value of UL in various context and research ways to realize an UL.

                                    The extensive practices of DDD in the community, 
                                    in particular the popular Event Storming Workshop, shows again the big role played by collaboration in software development. 
                                    In this sub-forum, we will review collaborative design from multiple perspective. The collaboration could be software architecture design,
                                    product design, interactive design or code design.

                                    The past five years saw that the majority of the software industry embraced the essential role played by DDD in software architecture design.
                                    It is evident that the effects of DDD are given the full play in many aspects of software architecture design, including Microservice Architecture, Revolutionary Architecture, 
                                    Enterprise Architecture design and enterprise mid-end design. 
                                    It is hoped that this forum can deliver many fruits of software architecture design so that the attendees can fully understand the value and power of DDD.

                                Lead and/or Architect is also changing. The responsibility of the architect is changing from
                                defining the architectural elements for the team, towards providing the team with rapid feedback
                                and evolving the architecture continuously. In this theme, we will invite front-line architects
                                and technical leaders of the development teams to share through their practical experiences to
                                bring insights about what the architects are doing in the teams practicing DDD.

                                In 2017, Neal Ford, Rebecca Parson, and Patric Kua co-authored a book entitled "Building an
                                Evolutionary Architecture." A new architecture governance model was introduced to the industry.
                                The authors define the evolutionary architecture with three key attributes: incremental, guided,
                                and multi-dimension, which form a new way of constructing quick architectural feedback. In this
                                theme, we will focus on specific industry cases in the three dimensions of the evolutionary
                                architecture. We hope to help the audiences have a better understanding of the evolutionary
                                architecture.

                                In DDD China Summit 2017, unconference discussions around Domain-Driven Design and Function
                                Programming (FP) sparked some real interesting conversations. Participants conducted in-depth
                                discussions on how to integrate DDD principles and practices with FP. This year, we would like
                                to further discuss the applications of DDD in FP, Serverless, and Flow Based Programming. We
                                hope to take a glimpse on the role of Domain-Driven Design in the future of responsive design.

                        DDD Conference is organized by a group of ThoughtWorks architects, leaders of DDD practitioners in China, to build a platform where DDD practitioners can exchange ideas and share success stories.

                        The DDD Conference 2018 was hosted at Beijing International Convention Center in December 2018 under the joint efforts made by the participants and friends of the community. The conference attracted DDD leaders and practitioners across many fields at home and abroad inspired the attendees by the rich and diversified user cases.        </p>

                        Over the past half year, more companies and teams made arduous efforts in dovetailing DDD guidelines and their business scenarios. By establishing a unified language that brings more efficient business and technology communication, the responding capability of the system has been largely improved.
