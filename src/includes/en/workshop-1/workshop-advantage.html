                    Domain scenario-driven design as a solidified software design process, is meant to reduce the
                    requirements of the domain-driven design to the technical level of the development team, to form a
                    development practice that is easier to land. In this way, it is conducive to be promoted and
                    practiced within enterprises. Through this practical workshop, you will learn how to apply event
                    storming to specific project development and use it for domain modeling, design and programming
                    development to improve the quality of development while reducing business complexity. You will learn
                    how to use the scenario-driven design to solidify the design and development process helping
                    existing development teams achieve a soft landing of domain-driven design under complex systems </p>
