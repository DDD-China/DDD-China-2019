                    Domain scenario-driven design practical workshop will use the event storming as the vertical line,
                    the domain scenario as the cross-section, and introduce the scenario-driven design and test-driven
                    development to complete the whole process from domain modeling to coding implementation. Content
                    covers event storming, scenario-driven design, and test-driven development. The entire workshop
                    revolves around the case of online learning classrooms. Domain driven design method with practical
                    value will be fully practiced. </p>
