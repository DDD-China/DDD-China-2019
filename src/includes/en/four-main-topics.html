                            Ubiquitous language for domain-driven design

                        Ubiquitous language (UL) is essential to domain-driven design (DDD). 
                        Eric Evans believes constructing a ubiquitous language within a domain of context is a prerequisite for DDD strategies. 
                        The UL varies in terms of meaning and building process in different organizations. 
                        In this sub-forum, we will pay attention to the precise meaning and value of UL in various context and research ways to realize an UL.

                            The extensive practices of DDD in the community, 
                            in particular the popular Event Storming Workshop, shows again the big role played by collaboration in software development. 
                            In this sub-forum, we will review collaborative design from multiple perspective. The collaboration could be software architecture design,
                            product design, interactive design or code design.

                            The past five years saw that the majority of the software industry embraced the essential role played by DDD in software architecture design.
                            It is evident that the effects of DDD are given the full play in many aspects of software architecture design, including Microservice Architecture, Revolutionary Architecture, 
                            Enterprise Architecture design and enterprise mid-end design. 
                            It is hoped that this forum can deliver many fruits of software architecture design so that the attendees can fully understand the value and power of DDD.

                        With the development of Domain-Driven Design practices, the working model of the team's Tech
                        Lead and/or Architect is also changing. The responsibility of the architect is changing from
                        defining the architectural elements for the team, towards providing the team with rapid feedback
                        and evolving the architecture continuously. In this theme, we will invite front-line architects
                        and technical leaders of the development teams to share through their practical experiences to
                        bring insights about what the architects are doing in the teams practicing DDD.

                        In 2017, Neal Ford, Rebecca Parson, and Patric Kua co-authored a book entitled "Building an
                        Evolutionary Architecture." A new architecture governance model was introduced to the industry.
                        The authors define the evolutionary architecture with three key attributes: incremental, guided,
                        and multi-dimension, which form a new way of constructing quick architectural feedback. In this
                        theme, we will focus on specific industry cases in the three dimensions of the evolutionary
                        architecture. We hope to help the audiences have a better understanding of the evolutionary
                        architecture.

                        In DDD China Summit 2017, unconference discussions around Domain-Driven Design and Function
                        Programming (FP) sparked some real interesting conversations. Participants conducted in-depth
                        discussions on how to integrate DDD principles and practices with FP. This year, we would like
                        to further discuss the applications of DDD in FP, Serverless, and Flow Based Programming. We
                        hope to take a glimpse on the role of Domain-Driven Design in the future of responsive design.
